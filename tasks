Task 1:
Print "Hello, World!"

Task 2; if-else:
Given an integer, n, perform the following conditional action:
If n is odd, print Weird
If n is even and in the inclusive range of 2 to 5, print Not Weird
If n is even and in the inclusive range of 6 to 20, print Weird
If n is even and greater than 20, print Not Weird

Task 3:
The provided code stub reads two integers from STDIN,a and b. Add code to print three lines where:
1.The first line contains the sum of the two numbers.
2.The second line contains the difference of the two numbers (first - second).
3.The third line contains the product of the two numbers.

Task 4:
The provided code stub reads two integers,a and b,from STDIN.
Add logic to print two lines.
The first line should contain the result of integer division,a//b.
The second line should contain the result of float division,a/b.
No rounding or formatting is necessary.
